$\dfrac{k - f(m - 1)}{f(m) - f(m - 1)}$

$f(m - 1)  f(m)$

This can be modeled by the following equation (taken from here):

Hm(k)={0k<f(m−1)  k−f(m−1)f(m)−f(m−1)f(m−1)≤k<f(m)  1k=f(m)  f(m+1)−kf(m+1)−f(m)f(m)<k≤f(m+1)  0k>f(m+1) 

After applying the filter bank to the power spectrum (periodogram) of the signal, we obtain the following spectrogram:
