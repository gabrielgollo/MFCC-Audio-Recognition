# Framing

After pre-emphasis, we need to split the signal into short-time frames. The rationale behind this step is that frequencies in a signal change over time, so in most cases it doesnâ€™t make sense to do the Fourier transform across the entire signal in that we would lose the frequency contours of the signal over time. To avoid that, we can safely assume that frequencies in a signal are stationary over a very short period of time. Therefore, by doing a Fourier transform over this short-time frame, we can obtain a good approximation of the frequency contours of the signal by concatenating adjacent frames.

Typical frame sizes in speech processing range from 20 ms to 40 ms with 50% (+/-10%) overlap between consecutive frames. Popular settings are 25 ms for the frame size, frame_size = 0.025 and a 10 ms stride (15 ms overlap), frame_stride = 0.01.
